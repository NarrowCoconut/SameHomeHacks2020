                        <b>Introductions</b>
                        <p> Every once in a while, a student asks us "why are you here?"  It's a fair question.  Each computer scientist has his or her own reasons.  Some are engineers, and want to build stuff.  Some are mathematicians, and the mathematical underpinnings of the discipline are very rich.  Others are scientists and want to discover new things.</p>

                        <p>For an easy 100 on a lab, introduce yourself.  To get credit, you must address each of the following topics:</p>

                        <p>1. An introduction; what should we know about you?</p>
                        <p>2. Three or four sentences reacting to these  observations from a former Wake Tech CS instructor  (in that attached Word document).</p>
                        <p>3. Two or three sentences on why you are here.</p>

                        <p>Use this discussion board.  You'll have to create a thread.</p>

                    <b>Employee, Manager, Executive</b>
                    <p>Write a class Employee with a name and salary.  Have (at least) getters for name and salary.  Whether you have setters or some other mechanism to set name and salary is up to you.  Employee should be in package edu.waketech.csc251.hr.person.</p>

                    <p>Make a class Manager inherit from Employee.  Add an instance variable department of type String. Manager should be in package edu.waketech.csc251.hr.mgmt.</p>

                    <p>Make a class Executive inherit from Manager.  Executive salaries are calculated differently the Employee or Manager salaries.  An Executive's salary is the sum of the salary he (or she) gets as an Employee, plus a bonus.  The bonus is expressed as a ratio that is multiplied by the Executive's Employee salary.  For example, if an Executive's base salary (i.e., the salary as an Employee) is $230,000, and the Executive has a bonus of 0.2, the Executive's (true) salary would be $230,000 + $230,000 * 0.2.  Executive should have a getSalary method, a setBonusRate method to set the bonus rate.  Executive should be in package edu.waketech.csc251.hr.mgmt.</p>

                    <p>Supply a test program that test all classes and methods.  The tests should include (but not be limited to) tests such as</p>

                        <p><i>System.out.println(dilbert);</i></p>
